Logistic Regression Lab

This repository contains the Coursera Machine Learning Week 3 lab on Logistic Regression, implemented in Python. The lab demonstrates building, training, and evaluating logistic regression models on two datasets:

University Admissions – Predict whether a student gets admitted based on two exam scores.

Microchip Quality Assurance – Predict whether microchips pass QA tests based on two test scores (with regularization).

The notebook walks through:

Loading and visualizing datasets

Implementing the sigmoid function

Computing the cost function and gradient

Optimizing parameters using gradient descent

Making predictions and evaluating model accuracy

Implementing regularized logistic regression for complex datasets

All helper functions (data loading, plotting, and unit tests) are included in utils.py, public_tests.py, and test_utils.py.
